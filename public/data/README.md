# Managing Millions of Markdown Articles

This guide explains how to manage a large collection of markdown articles for your website.

## Scalable Article Management

When dealing with millions of articles, the following system has been implemented:

1. **File Storage**: All articles are stored as individual `.md` files in the `public/data` directory
2. **Dynamic Loading**: Articles are loaded on-demand using browser fetch API
3. **Indexing**: An `index.json` file in the data directory catalogs all articles
4. **Pagination**: Articles are loaded in batches for efficiency

## Creating the Index

To generate the index file after adding new articles:

1. Run the index generator: `npx ts-node src/lib/generate-article-index.ts`
2. This will scan all .md files in the data directory and create/update `index.json`

## Article File Format

Each article must include these metadata fields at the top:

```markdown
---
title: Your Article Title
description: A brief description of the article
date: YYYY-MM-DD
author: Your Name
tags: ['tag1', 'tag2', 'tag3']
---

# Main Heading

Your article content goes here...
```

## Adding New Articles

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `public/data` directory
2. Name the file with a URL-friendly name (e.g., `your-article-title.md`)
3. Add the required frontmatter at the top between `---` delimiters
4. Write your article content using Markdown syntax
5. After adding articles, regenerate the index file

## Hosting Considerations

For millions of articles, consider these options:

1. **CDN Distribution**: Store articles on a CDN for faster global access
2. **Server-Side API**: Create a server endpoint that returns paginated articles
3. **Database Integration**: For advanced search, store article metadata in a database
4. **Search Index**: Implement a search service like Algolia or Elasticsearch

## Automated Publishing

For large-scale article management:

1. Set up CI/CD pipelines to automatically rebuild the index when new articles are added
2. Create admin tools for content management
3. Implement a staging system for article review before publication

## Performance Optimization

1. Implement lazy loading for article lists
2. Cache frequently accessed articles
3. Use server-side rendering for initial page load
4. Consider implementing server-side search for large collections
